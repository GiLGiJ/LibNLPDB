The 3 Dichotomies:
Structure / Data
Generality / Specific
Similarity / Difference


Names / Labels (and their opposites when they exist) are boundaries, while non-directed learning 
with numbers is the unnamed range between those boundaries (ie. Similarity/Difference).


Nominal Hierarchy->
-Nouns
--Consisting of Parts
---Other Nouns are constituents of this Noun
---This Noun is a constituent of other Nouns
--Modifiers
---Adjectives, Adverbs and transformed Objects of the Preposition
---Verbs
----Parts
----Modifiers


Possible Rules:
Look for first- or second-order patterns in the Noun Hierarchy
Compare Nouns by their properties to get a distance (eg. Similarity/Difference score).

#NN(var) (should equal) #VB(var;nonconsec) + #MOD(var;nonconsec) + ??
?? is then where the interest lies; JJ JJ NNS VB(x) VB(x) OR IN NN OR ...
